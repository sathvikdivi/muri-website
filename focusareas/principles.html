					<p> Organisms which exhibit ultra-fast motions — for example prey-capture strikes, jumps, or to launch projectiles — typically achieve accelerations and velocities that substantially exceed the capabilities of muscle alone. It is known that, across the tree of life, organisms such as trap-jaw ants, mantis shrimp, fleas, ballistophores, carnivorous plants and many other examples leverage latch-mediated spring actuation (LaMSA) to overcome muscle limits, enabling a physical and temporal separation between slow, low power spring loading and fast, high power spring unloading. Technologically, many devices, old and new, also use LaMSA to overcome common limitations of traditional motors.  Examples range from archery bows to jumping robots.  While biological and technological LaMSA examples may appear quite different, they are grounded in a common set of underlying principles.  Advancing the understanding of these principles is critical for navigating the complex, multidisciplinary space that is LaMSA and for using this understanding to expand our relationship with the natural world while also learning from nature to build advanced technologies in a sustainable manner.
					</p>
					<p> <ul> The underlying principles of LaMSA are grounded in the components that enable LaMSA function:
							<li>
							Actuators (e.g. muscles, motors, turgor pressure) store mechanical energy in spring components with the aid of a latch. Actuator power output does not change across size scale.
							</li>
							<li>
							Springs (e.g. elastic structures, metamaterial spring) release stored energy at peak acceleration and velocity as defined by their materials properties, geometry, and environment.
							</li>
							<li>
							Latches (e.g. physical contact, fluidics, geometric latches) mediate the potential energy to kinetic energy through physical contacts or changes in geometric configurations. Latches are used both for holding the potential energy and mediating the release.
							</li>
							<li>
							Control (e.g., latch removal (release), loading the spring (loading)) of LaMSA includes loading the potential energy to the spring prior to the impulsive behavior, and mediate the release of latch in order to achieve the specific objectives (e.g. catching a prey, running away). 
							</li>
						</ul>
